# Git Commands to Push to Modularized Branch

Since you're working on the `modularized` branch, here are the commands to push your changes:

## 1. Check current branch status
```bash
git status
```

## 2. Add all changes to staging
```bash
git add .
```

## 3. Commit the changes
```bash
git commit -m "Refactor games into modular structure

- Organized Crystal Quest and Star Hunter into separate directories
- Each game now has its own HTML, CSS, and JS files
- Improved code organization and maintainability
- Added proper file structure for future development"
```

## 4. Push to the modularized branch
```bash
git push origin modularized
```

## Alternative: If this is the first push to this branch
```bash
git push -u origin modularized
```

## 5. Verify the push was successful
```bash
git log --oneline -5
```

**Note:** These commands should be run in your local development environment where Git is available. The WebContainer environment doesn't support Git operations directly.
