# Deployment Instructions for Modularized Games

## Current Project Structure
```

## Option 1: Manual File Transfer

1. **Copy the files** from this WebContainer to your local repository
2. **Navigate to your local repository** in terminal
3. **Ensure you're on the modularized branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout modularized
   ```
4. **Add and commit the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Refactor games into modular structure

   - Organized Crystal Quest and Star Hunter into separate directories
   - Each game now has its own HTML, CSS, and JS files
   - Improved code organization and maintainability
   - Added proper file structure for future development"
   ```
5. **Push to remote:**
   ```bash
   git push origin modularized
   ```

## Option 2: Create Archive

If you need to transfer multiple files easily:

1. Create a zip/tar archive of the project structure
2. Extract it in your local repository
3. Follow the git commands above

## Option 3: Deploy Directly

Each game can now be deployed independently:

### Crystal Quest
- Navigate to `/crystal-quest/` directory
- Open `index.html` in browser or deploy to hosting service

### Star Hunter  
- Navigate to `/star-hunter/` directory
- Open `index.html` in browser or deploy to hosting service

## Benefits of This Structure

✅ **Independent Games** - Each game is self-contained
✅ **Easy Maintenance** - Changes to one game don't affect others
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new games
✅ **Deployable** - Each game can be hosted separately
✅ **Collaborative** - Team members can work on different games

## Next Steps

1. Transfer files to your local Git repository
2. Push to the `modularized` branch
3. Consider setting up CI/CD for automatic deployment
4. Each game directory can be deployed to separate hosting services if needed
